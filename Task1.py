#Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

f = input('Enter the first number: ')
s = input('Enter the second number: ')

f = int(f)
s = int(s)

addition = f + s
subtraction = f - s
multiplication = f * s
division = f / s

print('Addition:', addition)
print('Subtraction:', subtraction)
print('Multiplication:', multiplication)
print('Division', division)
